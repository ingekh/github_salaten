                <h3>White Bellbird</h3>
                <p>Don't let the its appearance fool you. It is literally the loudest bird known to man, and it sounds like something between a smoke detector and factory alarm.</p>

                <p>A very known animal native to Africa. Even though it's a known one, it's still weird looking. Its long neck helps it to eat from tall trees.</p>
